# ATT&CK<sup>™</sup> Navigator
Stripped down version of original [ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org) repo. This is setup in order to facilitate the ease of implementation for an internally hosted git repository.

Layers will need to be placed under [enterprise/assets/]
[enterprise/assets/config.json] will need to be updated for new default layers as needed
